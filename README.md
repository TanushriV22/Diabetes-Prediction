# Diabetes-Prediction
# AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
The AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on various medical and lifestyle factors. This README provides instructions for running the code and an overview of the project's key components.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook for running the code (optional, but recommended)

Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
## Dataset
- *Dataset Source:* The dataset used for this project was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set], and it contains a collection of medical data, including patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and diabetes outcomes.

- *Data Description:* The dataset includes [brief description of dataset content], making it suitable for training a diabetes prediction model.

- *Data Preprocessing:* The data has undergone thorough preprocessing to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers. It has also been standardized and cleaned for optimal model performance.

## Running the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
 https://github.com/TanushriV22/Diabetes-Prediction
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Diabetes-Prediction
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
After running the code, the model's performance will be evaluated based on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
 Feel free to use and modify the code for your own purposes.

Happy predicting!
